# addressbook

### addressbook is a simple angular 1.6 web application that takes an xml file of multiple contacts and their info and displays them as a table, or as mock business cards

* The user can click on one of the two tabs above the content section to switch between each view.

* On the card view only 10 results are displayed to begin with. To see more you can click on the "show more contacts" button

## Getting started:

* The simplest way to run this app is through python simple server which, for a simple app like this, is much easier than running it though node.
* Assuming python is added to your system path, navigate to the app directory in commandline and type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" for python2.x or "python -m http.server" if python3.x is installed. I always use 2.7 because python3 is garbage.
* Now that the server is running simply go into your browser and navigate to http://localhost:"whatever port your server is on" in most cases it will be http://localhost:8000/. The site should be up and running at this point.
* To close the server simply hit ctrl-c. Sometimes it will take a minute to close out but just give it a minute. If it complains just hit ctrl-c again or just close the commandline.
