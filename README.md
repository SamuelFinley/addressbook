### addressbook is a simple angular 1.6 web application that takes an xml file of multiple contacts and their info and displays them as a table, or as mock business cards

* The user can click on one of the two tabs above the content section to switch between each view.

* The search bar and select box allows the user to refine the list of contacts to their specification. When a search is preformed the card view will contain only the contacts which match their search while the table view will show the original list with the matching rows highlighted.

* Should a user only want to search a specific category they can use the select box located to the immediate right of the searchbar. To return to the full list of contacts simply click on the "show all" button to the right of the search bar.
